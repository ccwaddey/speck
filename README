speck - a very tiny window manager
============================
speck is a very small window manager that is mostly just a stripped
down version of dwm.


Requirements
------------
In order to build speck you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
First, edit config.mk to match your local setup (speck is installed into
$HOME/bin by default). Configure at least the termcmd in config.def.h
so you have something to work with once you're in speck.

Then run make && make install.


Running speck
-------------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start speck using startx:

    exec $HOME/bin/speck

You may need to modify .xsession instead, depending on how you start
X. If you have xwallpaper installed, you can prepend the exec command
with xwallpaper --stretch PATH/TO/background.png, which is included
for a shortcut of various keybindings. In order to connect speck to a
specific display, make sure that the DISPLAY environment variable is
set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec $HOME/bin/speck

(This will start speck on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of speck is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
